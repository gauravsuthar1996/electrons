Another big purpose for its construction is to watch the progress of Monsoon clouds.This Monsoon Palace is situated at such an altitude that it presents magnificent views of Lake Pichola, Aravalli mountains, and surrounding countryside. Visitors also love the sunset of Sajjangarh Palace. There is also Sajjangarh Wildlife Sanctuary which encircles the palace. Now it is a forest department property and open for visitors.
